# What's an API?
    Application Programming Interface = way to interact with a remote application programmatically.

*Example*
-  When an app like Swiggy or Uber shows a map or calculates distance, it doesnâ€™t create the map itself
-  It uses the Google Maps API to *request* that data.
-  Google gives *response* with the map or distance.

The API acts like a waiter taking your order and bringing back what you asked for.
